            <p>
                Allie and Noah met in Ocean City on Labor Day weekend through their mutual friend, Brad. As with any
                trip to Ocean City, there were daytime activities of sun, sand, and waves, followed by nighttime
                activities of music, food, and
                Seacrets. After an evening filled with fun, Cam and Dan shared a quiet moment on the beach, under the
                night stars and the sounds of the crashing waves, culminating in their first kiss.</p>

            <p> Upon returning from their beach trip, Allie and Noah continued to chat back
                and forth, often through email like a reenactment of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in “You’ve Got Mail”
                (personal phones weren’t allowed at Noah’s work). Their first date included a trip to Cheesecake
                Factory,
                as Noah loves cheesecake, and ended with a night of bowling where Allie was surprised to see that Noah
                owned
                a pair of bowling shoes. Obviously, Allie lost that night.</p>

            <p>Allie and Noah love traveling internationally together. Some of their favorite places include the Amalfi
                Coast, Paris, London, Dubrovnik, and Prague. Even amongst the non-stop sight-seeing and evening
                cuisine, Cam always made sure there was an opportunity for a daily Gelato.
                While 2020 was a challenging year for many, Allie and Noah managed to end the year on a high-note,
                specifically on Christmas Eve. During the evening, while ensuring that all of the presents were under
                the tree before Christmas day with family, Noah surprised Allie with an early present. With the
                twinkling of the Christmas lights in the background, Noah popped the question while on one knee and
                Allie
                said yes!</p>

                        <p>Matt is my younger brother who I’ve known since birth (that shouldn’t be a
                            surprise, right?).
                            Matt also
                            enjoys traveling with us and is looking to plan some trips of his own. Often you’ll find
                            Matt
                            and I
                            playing online games together, or him coming over for some grilling and hanging out or to
                            watch
                            a UFC
                            sporting event. Although he has a goofy and sarcastic nature, Matt is always there for his
                            friends and
                            family when needed.</p>

                        <p>I have known Morgan since Middle School. We attended the same high school and even worked
                            at the same grocery store together during our college days. We both share the joys and
                            disappointments of
                            being Ravens’ fans, often sharing commentary back and forth during the games. Morgan also
                            took
                            the Computer Science path for education and work, leading to the occasional nerdy
                            conversation
                            about computers and software. Morgan currently develops software for UPS, so if your package
                            ever goes missing, you know who to blame.</p>

                        <p>I met Chuck during high school as he was a close friend of Morgan and the Farmer family.
                            Chuck
                            also worked at the same grocery store during my high school and college days, transforming
                            it
                            from just a plain old job into a paid activity while amongst friends. Chuck enjoys playing
                            the
                            Bass guitar, occasionally jamming out bands, and fancies himself a whiskey man. Whenever we
                            have
                            get-togethers for sporting events or just to grill, there is always a wild story from our
                            past
                            that we end up looking back on.

                        <p>I grew up with Val. We were in girl scouts and went to Sunday School together when we were
                            little kids. Her first
                            love
                            is her dog, Simba. Although I’m not her first love, I do claim second. She is a kind and
                            thoughtful friend who is always there whenever you need her and will do anything for the
                            people
                            she loves. Well, except for going to crowded places like NY with me. It’s my mission to get
                            her
                            there one day! We share odd eating related quirks. We both prefer to eat on the floor, enjoy
                            eating dried ramen with the seasoning packs sprinkled on top, and having lunch or dinner
                            food
                            for breakfast. </p>

                        <p>I met Libby in college right before walking into the first day of our Economics class. As our
                            bond grew, we started skipping classes in favor of food and parks. Our friendship grew as we
                            became adults and somehow ended up working 5 minutes from each other! We are both Costco
                            lovers,
                            travel dreamers and I continue to be amazed at all her “tests”.</p>
